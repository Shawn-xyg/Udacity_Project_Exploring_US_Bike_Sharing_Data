# Udacity_Project_Exploring_US_Bike_Sharing_Data
The project involves using Python to analyze a set of US Bike Sharing data. 

# Summary
* This process will be done using a Jupyter Notebook.
* Appropriate use of
  * data structures/types
  * loops/conditional statements
  * Packages
  * functions
  * coding practices (i.e. Docstrings, comments, variable names & general readability)

# Steps
1. Data cleaning to make the dataset suitable for cleaning.
2. Defining functions to help with the analyzing process
3. Using matplotlib to explore and visualize data to better communicate the results
4. Draw conclusions from the visualizations
Submission
The jupyter notebook will be exported to PDF and submitted as a github repository.
